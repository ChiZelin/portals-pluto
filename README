README for 1.1-286-COMPATIBILITY branch of Pluto
This branch holds the development source code that will become the 
JSR-286 (Portlet 2.0) reference implementation. It is anticipated that
this source code will be eventually merged into the SVN trunk to
become Pluto 2.0.

To build a binary distribution with Pluto installed in Tomcat 5.5,
make sure you have Ant 1.6+ and Maven 2.0.4+ installed and run
the dist-build.xml Ant script with the command line:

ant -f dist-build.xml

Upon successful completion of the build, the distribution will be found in the
target/dist directory.

The Ant build uses Maven to build the distribution. Details are found in the
comments on the top of dist-build.xml.
